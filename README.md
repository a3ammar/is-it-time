# Is it time yet?

A simple countdown app I made to learn React. [Demo](https://a3ammar.github.io/is-it-time/).


## Installation

You mean you actually want to run this thing?

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/a3ammar/is-it-time.git
$ cd is-it-time
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

I use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), figure it out if you want to use other package managers.

## Thanks

The countdown converts Hijri dates using the awesome https://util.services/ by [Musharraf Alsakran](https://twitter.com/MusharrafSakran).
