# Is it time yet?

A simple countdown app I made to learn React. [Demo](https://a3ammar.github.io/is-it-time/).

The app accepts `date` query string to set the countdown, the default value is equivalent to:

```
https://a3ammar.github.io/is-it-time/?date=1-10-1438
```

## Installation

You mean you actually want to run this thing?

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/a3ammar/is-it-time.git
$ cd is-it-time
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Thanks

The countdown converts Hijri dates using the awesome https://util.services/ by [Musharraf Alsakran](https://twitter.com/MusharrafSakran).
